- Our Home Page features a user-friendly navigation bar for easy access to various sections of the website. You'll find a captivating banner/slider showcasing the essence of our event management services. There's a dedicated "Services" section where you can explore six unique event services, each accompanied by a name, image, price, and a brief description. At the bottom of the page, you'll find our footer.

- We offer two prominent features: "Client Services" and "Private Routes." "Client Services" highlight the exceptional benefits we provide to our clients, while "Private Routes" are restricted pages, ensuring that only registered users can access them.

- To access our private routes and services details pages, users must undergo email and password-based authentication. Clicking the "Show Details" button on any service will redirect users to the login page if they are not already logged in. If you don't have an account yet, you can easily register by clicking the "Do not have an Account?" option, which will take you to the registration page. After successful registration, you'll gain access to the login page. Once logged in, you can navigate to the  service details page.

- Our website prioritizes user security and convenience, ensuring that you have a seamless experience while accessing our event management services. Explore our offerings, and let us help you create memorable events!

- When you log in, your name and profile photo will be displayed in the navbar, making it easy to identify your account status. If you're not logged in, you'll see the "Log In" button in the navbar.
